\section math_model Mathematical Model
The transient temperature distribution @f$ T({\bf x},t) @f$ in a 
conducting medium is given by:

\f[
\rho c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) = 0,
\f]
where @f$ \rho @f$, @f$ c_p @f$ and @f$ k @f$ are the material 
density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity, respectively,
@f$ t @f$ denotes time and @f$ {\bf x}=(x,y,z) @f$.

In this paper, the temperature distribution is considered in both steady 
and unsteady state, with constant and variable material
properties, and in one, two or three-dimensional space, as 
described in the following sections.

\section man_sol Manufactured Solution

The general form of the manufactured temperature distribution 
@f$ T = T ({\bf x}, t) @f$ is chosen as a
function of cosines:
\f[
  T ({\bf x}, t) = \cos(A_x x + A_t t) \cdot \cos(B_y y + B_t t) \cdot \cos(C_z z + C_t t) \cdot \cos(D_t t) .
\f]

This solution satisfies the requirements of a suitable manufactured 
solution: it is smooth,
infinitely differentiable and realizable. Also, it is non-trivial, 
i.e., it does not vanish even in case of
some of the unknowns are equal to zero.

In sequence, a hierarchy of solutions which test various features 
of the governing equation is created. This includes
one, two and three-dimensional temperature distribution, steady and 
transient state, and constant and variable
material properties. For instance, a steady distribution is recovered when
@f$ A_t = B_t = C_t = D_t = 0 @f$; a one-dimensional distribution results 
when @f$ B = C = 0 @f$, while a two-dimensional distribution
results for @f$ C = 0 @f$. Moreover, while density @f$ \rho @f$ 
is considered constant, thermal capacity @f$ c_p @f$ and 
conductivity @f$ k @f$ can be modeled either as constant 
or variable. In the later case, 
they are approximated as a polynomial in @f$ T @f$.

Although the most general case would be represented by the 
@f$ 3D @f$ unsteady distribution with both @f$ k @f$ and 
@f$ c_p @f$ variable,
this paper is divided in two main sections: steady and 
transient distribution. Each one of these sections is subdivided
into other two sections, in case of constant and variable material 
properties, and source terms obtained for @f$ 1D @f$, @f$ 2D @f$ 
and @f$ 3D @f$ cases are presented.

Steady Conduction

For the steady case, our governing equation is simplified to the form:
\f[
 - \nabla \cdot (k \nabla T) = 0.
\f]

By considering @f$ A_t = B_t = C_t = D_t = 0 @f$, it yields:
\f[
  T ({\bf x}) = \cos(A_x x ) \cdot \cos(B_y y ) \cdot \cos(C_z z ).
\f]

In sequence, both approximations for @f$ k @f$ (constant or variable) 
are used in order to obtain source term~ @f$ Q @f$ for the steady 
temperature distribution from manufactured solution.
