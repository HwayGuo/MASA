/*! \page add_sol Adding Additional Manufactured Solutions to MASA

MASA permits users to import additional solutions directly into the codebase. 
It is the hope of the developers that this import mechanism will streamline the process of 
adding and testing manufactured solutions, which in turn will encourage users to 
contribute patch files with additional MMS to MASA, expanding the scope of the available
solutions and broadening its appeal as a community tool. 

To import a solution into MASA, the user is required to have:

\li C/C++ file with your source terms.
   Each source term function should start with, "eval_q_"

\li C/C++ file that contains your analytical terms.
   Each analytical function should start with, "eval_exact_"

   For both the source and analytical terms:
   The functions should only take doubles or floats as arguments.
   Please ensure that the function arguments are on the same line
   as the function name, e.g. \n
   \t double eval_exact_t(double x, double y)

   Instead of: \n
   \t double eval_exact_t(double x,\n
   \t\t                    double y)


\li A file that contains all the variables required
   by your solutions. Each variable should be on a newline
   and the default value should be on the same row, separated
   by a space.

Finally, run from a command line: "perl masa_import.pl".
This will complete the process of integrating the
solution into the MASA codebase. Future work will expand this functionality to 
permit the user to include analytically calculated gradient functions, as well as 
directly importing LaTeX documents into the MASA documentation. 

For more information, check "readme" in src/import.
Check the subdirectory: "src/import/examples" for examples of each file.
Finally, to revert your local version, simply copy the contents of the folder backup 
into src to revert back.
