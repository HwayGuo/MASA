/*! \page model Library Overview

The MASA (Manufactured Analytical Solutions Abstraction) library is a software interface that provides access 
to various manufactured solutions for a wide variety of differential equations. The library is written in C++, 
and provides an API for development in C and Fortran.

<h2>Software Verification</h2>

Verification of numerical computations, in which one asks if numerical results are an accurate representation of the solution 
to the mathematical model that is being solved, is relatively well understood. It requires 
careful attention to good software engineering practices, continuous software testing, and control of numerical 
discretization errors, through error estimation and adaptivity. While verification processes are well understood, 
they require substantial effort. As verification of numerical results is a prerequisite for reliable computational 
predictions, verification processes are integral to all activities in scientific computation.

MASA is designed to simplify the verification process by providing a common repository of manufactured solutions 
for common problems in scientific computation. 

<h2>Available Solutions</h2>

Euler Equations
Compressible Navier-Stokes 
Sod Shock Tube 
Various RANS models

<h2>Manufactured Solution Generation</h2>

The analytical solutions used in this library were generated using symbolic manipulation software, such as Maple.

<h2>PECOS Center Background</h2>

The Center for Predictive Engineering and COmputational Sciences (PECOS) is a DOE-funded Center 
of Excellence within the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) 
at The University of Texas at Austin. PECOS is one of five such centers sponsored under 
the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP) of the National Nuclear Security 
Administrationâ€™s Advanced Simulation and Computing Program.

PECOS brings together an interdisciplinary, multi-university team with partners at the 
DOE National Labs and NASA. The goal of the PECOS Center is to develop the next generation 
of advanced computational methods for predictive simulation of multiscale, multiphysics phenomena, 
and to apply these methods to the analysis of vehicles reentering the atmosphere. In pursuing 
this research, PECOS is advancing the science and modeling of atmospheric reentry, and 
the science of predictive simulation.

<h2> Developers </h2>

Developers of the MASA library include:

Paul Bauman
Kemelli Estacio-Hiroms
Nicholas Malaya
Todd Oliver
Onkar Sahni
Karl W. Schulz
Chris Simmons

/*! \page installation Installation/Linkage

libMASA uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool)
for its development build system.  This system is popular among the
Linux development community and provides a familiar build environment
for end users.  

To build libMASA starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution and
enter the top-level directory.

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 > tar xvfz masa-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd masa-$(VERSION)/            
</pre></div>

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

Since libMASA provides a Fortran interface, a valid Fortran90 compiler is
also required.  To date, libMASA has been successfully tested with \e
gfortran and the Intel \e ifort compilers.  The configuration step
will look for available compilers in the user environment but as with
any \e autoconf based configuration, these can be overridden with
command line arguments (by setting \c CXX, \c FC, and \c F77
appropriately).

<b>Installation Directory</b>: Use the <tt>--prefix</tt> option to
specify your desired top-level installation directory for MASA.  The
examples below all configure libMASA to be installed in the user's ~/bin/masa
directory.

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If successful, this
will build the libMASA library (static and dynamic versions) and several
examples.

\code > make \endcode

<b> Verifying the build:</b> To verify that the software is working
properly, a test option is provided to run a short suite of
functionality tests against the local build.  To run, issue a <tt>make
check</tt> to run the tests.  If successful, output similar to the
following will be generated.

\code
 > make check

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue a <tt>make install</tt> to install
the library.  The installation will consist of three top-level
directories housing the library, include files, and
example files.  An example of the top-level directories after
installation is shown below:

\code > make install \endcode

Top-level libMASA installation directory:

\code
 > ls $HOME/bin/masa/
 examples/  include/  lib/
\endcode

<h2>Library Linkage</h2>

To link an external C/C++ or Fortran application with the library, the
\c include directory must be added to the compilers include search
path in order to access the masa.h header file (or for Fortran, the \c
lib directory should be added to access the pre-compiled
masa F90 module).  The \c lib directory should also be added
to the linker search path along with a request to link against the
libMASA library.  Several example link steps are provided below.  These
examples assume that the libMASA library has been successfully built and
installed previously in the users's ~/bin/masa directory:

<h3>C/C++ Example</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/masa/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/masa/lib -lmasa \endcode

<h3>Fortran Example</h3>

Fortran applications also require linking against the fmasa library:

\code > $(FC) -I$HOME/bin/masa/lib app.f90 -L$HOME/bin/masa/lib -lfmasa -lmasa \endcode

To embed the dynamic library search path for the libMASA library
directly into the application executable, use an additional linker
option as follows:

<h3>C/C++ Example</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/masa/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/masa/lib \
         -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/bin/masa/lib -lmasa \endcode


<b>Important Note:</b> F90 module file formats are not consistent
across multiple compilers. Therefore, a Fortran application and the libMASA
F90 interface \em must be built with the same Fortran compiler family to ensure
compatibility.
