\section overview Overview

The MASA (Manufactured Analytical Solutions Abstraction) library is
a software interface that provides access to all manufactured solutions to
 be used by various models throughout the PECOS center.
The library is written in
C++, but provides an API for development in C and Fortran.

The MASA (Manufactured Analytical Solutions Abstraction) library is a software interface that provides access 
to various manufactured solutions for a wide variety of differential equations. The library is written in C++, 
and provides an API for development in C and Fortran.

<h2>Software Verification</h2>

Verification of numerical computations, in which one asks if numerical results are an accurate representation of the solution 
to the mathematical model that is being solved, is relatively well understood. It requires 
careful attention to good software engineering practices, continuous software testing, and control of numerical 
discretization errors, through error estimation and adaptivity. While verification processes are well understood, 
they require substantial effort. As verification of numerical results is a prerequisite for reliable computational 
predictions, verification processes are integral to all activities in scientific computation.

MASA is designed to simplify the verification process by providing a common repository of manufactured solutions 
for common problems in scientific computation. 

<h2>Manufactured Solution Generation</h2>

The analytical solutions used in this library were generated using symbolic manipulation software, such as Maple.

<h2>PECOS Center Background</h2>

The Center for Predictive Engineering and COmputational Sciences (PECOS) is a DOE-funded Center 
of Excellence within the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) 
at The University of Texas at Austin. PECOS is one of five such centers sponsored under 
the Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program (PSAAP) of the National Nuclear Security 
Administrationâ€™s Advanced Simulation and Computing Program.

PECOS brings together an interdisciplinary, multi-university team with partners at the 
DOE National Labs and NASA. The goal of the PECOS Center is to develop the next generation 
of advanced computational methods for predictive simulation of multiscale, multiphysics phenomena, 
and to apply these methods to the analysis of vehicles reentering the atmosphere. In pursuing 
this research, PECOS is advancing the science and modeling of atmospheric reentry, and 
the science of predictive simulation.
