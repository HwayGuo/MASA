# Follow these instructions to import a new solution in MASA.   #
# This will require a perl interpreter.                         #
# ------------------------------------------------------------- #

1) You will need a file with your source terms. 
   Each source term function should start with, "eval_q_"

2) Create a file that contains your analytical terms.
   Each analytical function should start with, "eval_exact_"

3) Create a file that contains all the variables required 
   by your solutions. Each variable should be on a newline
   and the default value should be on the same row, separated 
   by a space. 

Finally, run from a command line: 'perl masa_import.pl'

Check the subdirectory: "examples" for examples of each file.
