# ------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Follow these instructions to import a new solution in MASA.   #
# This will require a perl interpreter.                         #
# ------------------------------------------------------------- #

1) You will need a C/C++ file with your source terms. 
   Each source term function should start with, "eval_q_"

2) Create a C/C++ file that contains your analytical terms.
   Each analytical function should start with, "eval_exact_"

   For both the source and analytical terms:
   The functions should only take doubles or floats as arguments.
   Please ensure that the function arguments are on the same line
   as the function name, e.g. double eval_exact_t(double x, double y)

   Instead of:

   double eval_exact_t(double x, 
                       double y)	


3) Create a file that contains all the variables required 
   by your solutions. Each variable should be on a newline
   and the default value should be on the same row, separated 
   by a space. 

Finally, run from a command line: 'perl masa_import.pl'

Check the subdirectory: "examples" for examples of each file.
Copy the contents of the folder backup into src to revert back.
