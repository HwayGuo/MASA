Version 0.30 (in progress)

  * improved parallel build support
  * code has 99%+ line coverage	
  * c++ bindings now support arbitrary precision (double, long double, etc.) w/ regression testing
  * gradient of source terms is now available
  * adding new conditional (--masa-exceptions) that adds exception handling
  * modifications to Fortran interface (no API changes)
  * added doxygen documentation for all c/cpp/fortran functions
  * edited navier stokes default parameters, added realizability regression test
  * ported to 32 bit mac, ubuntu environments
  * added reynolds averaged navier stokes solution
  * added check for presence of 'nan's within regression tests
  * fixed bug for axisymmetric euler and navier-stokes in 32 bit compilers
  * added support for PGI compilers (tested on version 10.8)
  * documentation heavily updated (make doc) and now slightly useful

Version 0.20 (23 September 2010)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/mms/MASA/releases/0.20
  
  * API change for numerous functions -- source terms now return double
  * initial support for Fortran interface (requires -lfmasa -lmasa linkage)
  * fixed support for parallel builds
  * bug fix in energy equation for 3d compressible navier stokes
  * added masa.m4 macro that allows users to include: 
    AX_PATH_MASA(version,optional) in configure.ac 
  * merged C/C++ headers into a single masa.h
  * added support for GNU code coverage analysis (--enable-coverage)
  * added support for absolute error check in regressions ( --enable-strict-tests)
  * regression testing greatly expanded--code has 95% line coverage
  * added axisymmetric compressible navier-stokes
  * added axisymmetric euler

Version 0.10 (01 September 2010)
https://svn.ices.utexas.edu/repos/pecos/mms/MASA/releases/0.10

  * MMS Solutions include heat equation, compressible Navier-Stokes,
    and Euler equations in one-,two-, and three-dimensions
  * several bug fixes
  * successfully tested on x86_64 with gnu and Intel compilers
  * force default C/CPP flags to -O0 and strict ANSI std.
  * added automake style test suite ("make check")
  * added library versioning routines
  * C/C++ bindings available

Version 0.01 (18 May 2010) - first internal code review
   * first mms functions tested 
   * API changes
   * C/fortran bindings detailed

Version 0.00 (01 January 2010) - initial import 
   * Basic API detailed
