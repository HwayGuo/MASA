BASIC INFORMATION:

Welcome to MASA, the Manufactured Analytical Solutions Abstraction Library. 

Check the EXAMPLES directory for examples of the MASA C++, C and Fortran API.
The source code is contained in MASA, and the regression tests are in tests.

BUILD INFORMATION:

MASA currently supports gcc and intel compilers. 

TO BUILD:

1) ./bootstrap
2) ./configure --prefix= top-level dir
3) make
4) make install

It is recommended that new users run 'make check'
This runs numerous diagnostic tests, which ensure the precision
of all associated solutions are at minimum, 10e-15.

TO ADD A NEW SOLUTION:

1) Type the new class in masa_internal.h
2) Add the constructor which sets all default variable names
3) Add the source term evaluation functions 
4) 'Register' the new solution in masa_core.cpp, get_list_mms
